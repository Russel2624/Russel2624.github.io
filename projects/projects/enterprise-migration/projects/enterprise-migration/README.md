# Enterprise Network Migration Project

## 📋 Project Overview
Migration of multi-branch corporate network from legacy RIP routing to OSPF with full network redesign.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Replace RIP with OSPF for better scalability
- Resolve IP addressing conflicts
- Implement VLAN segmentation
- Deploy centralized network services

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Routing:** OSPF, Route Redistribution
- **Switching:** VLANs, VTP, Inter-VLAN Routing
- **Services:** DHCP, DNS, SYSLOG
- **Platforms:** Cisco IOS, GNS3

## ⚙️ Configuration Snippets

### OSPF Configuration
```cisco
router ospf 1
 network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
```

### VLAN Configuration
```cisco
interface vlan 10
 name HR-Department
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
```

## 📈 Results
