# Network Assessment: Pre-Migration

## Current RIP Environment
- **Routing Protocol**: RIPv2
- **Network Scale**: 15 routers, 8 branch locations
- **Convergence Time**: 3-5 minutes during topology changes
- **Routing Table Size**: 45 routes in main routing table

## Identified Issues
### Performance Problems
- Slow convergence during link failures
- Suboptimal path selection in mesh topology
- Limited route summarization capabilities

### Scalability Limitations
- Maximum hop count of 15 restricting network growth
- Inefficient use of bandwidth due to full routing table updates
- No support for VLSM in some legacy equipment

### Management Challenges
- Difficult to implement traffic engineering
- Limited route filtering capabilities
- No hierarchical design for troubleshooting

## OSPF Benefits Analysis
- **Faster Convergence**: 5-10 seconds vs 3-5 minutes
- **Hierarchical Design**: Area segmentation for improved stability
- **Better Scalability**: No hop count limitations
- **Enhanced Security**: More granular route filtering

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Core routers and internet connectivity
- **Medium Risk**: Distribution layer and inter-branch links
- **Low Risk**: Access layer and stub networks
