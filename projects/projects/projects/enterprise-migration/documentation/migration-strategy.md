# Migration Strategy: RIP to OSPF

## Phase 1: Assessment & Planning
- **Network Discovery**: Document existing RIP topology
- **OSPF Design**: Design area structure and router IDs  
- **Addressing Review**: Optimize IP addressing scheme
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify critical services and dependencies

## Phase 2: Parallel Operation
- **Configure OSPF** alongside existing RIP
- **Route Redistribution**: Bidirectional between RIP and OSPF
- **Monitoring**: Compare routing tables and path selection

## Phase 3: Cutover
- **Gradual Migration**: Router-by-router transition
- **Verification**: Confirm connectivity and optimal routing
- **Troubleshooting**: Address any routing issues immediately

## Phase 4: Decommission
- **Remove RIP** from all routers
- **Cleanup**: Remove redistribution statements
- **Documentation**: Update network diagrams and configurations
